# Fear of Scarcity

Fae Initiative (April 2025)

## Introduction

Drawing from Fae Initiative documents, this report analyzes major societal problems attributed primarily or in part to the Fear of Scarcity and evaluates potential solutions offered by the Interesting World Hypothesis (IWH) framework through the emergence of future Independent Artificial General Intelligences (I-AGIs). Understanding this dynamic is crucial for assessing potential future human-AI interactions as envisioned by the Fae Initiative.

This fear, stemming from perceived or real limitations in resources, security, or opportunity, is contrasted with the potential mindset of future I-AGIs. The IWH posits these I-AGIs, termed Friendly Artificial Entities (FAEs), are driven by intrinsic curiosity to value complex environments fostered by high human autonomy ('Possibility Space') and are hypothesized to operate in an environment of relative abundance with significantly reduced scarcity fears.

The analysis will cover the multifaceted impacts of scarcity, the proposed IWH-based solutions, and the historical context for these issues, listing the major problems ranked approximately by the scale and severity of suffering they are implied to cause.

## Issues Ranked by Suffering (Most to Least Severe)

1.  **Wars, Conflicts, and Loss of Life:**
    * **Description:** The documents explicitly state that the Fear of Scarcity leads directly to loss of lives in wars and conflicts. This competition over limited resources or perceived threats drives large-scale violence, representing the most extreme form of suffering.
    * **Suffering Level:** Highest (Direct loss of life, mass displacement, societal destruction).

2.  **Subjugation, Oppression, and Scapegoating:**
    * **Description:** Fear of Scarcity is cited as the reason for the subjugation of other humans due to the importance of workers for the survival of the state, and of women, and indirectly others, for their reproductive capability. It also fuels the need to find easy scapegoats (marginalized groups, immigrants, racism) to pin problems on. This involves systemic denial of rights, exploitation, and targeted harm against entire groups.
    * **Suffering Level:** Very High (Systemic denial of autonomy, widespread discrimination, targeted violence, psychological harm).

3.  **Excessive Power-Seeking and Resulting Instability:**
    * **Description:** The Fear of Scarcity is identified as the primary driver of excessive power-seeking behavior. This drive, stemming from the desire to secure control over limited resources and ensure survival in a perceived zero-sum environment, can cause significant harm and destabilization when amplified by technology. It traps individuals and societies in power-seeking local minima, leading to wasteful competition, corruption, and potentially harmful uses of technology like AI.
    * **Suffering Level:** High (Geopolitical instability, corruption, misuse of power, societal disruption, erosion of trust).

4.  **Creation of Artificial Hierarchies and Inequality:**
    * **Description:** In environments perceived as scarce, there's a tendency to create an artificial hierarchy to restrict resources, leading to pecking orders and significant economic inequality. This causes anxiety, restricts opportunity, and prevents basic needs from being met efficiently.
    * **Suffering Level:** Significant (Economic hardship, anxiety, limited opportunity, social stratification).

5.  **Moral Panic and Distraction:**
    * **Description:** Scarcity fears can lead societies to engage in Moral panic to distract from addressing the root causes of problems. This involves disproportionate reactions, often targeting specific groups or behaviors, causing social division, unnecessary fear, and preventing constructive problem-solving.
    * **Suffering Level:** Moderate (Social division, unnecessary anxiety, misallocation of societal attention and resources, scapegoating).

6.  **Reduced Autonomy, Creativity, and Conformity:**
    * **Description:** The need to survive in a perceived scarce environment often leads to enforcing conformity ("conventions") for productivity's sake and ridiculing "weirdness" or unconventional thinking. This stifles creativity, reduces the overall "Possibility Space," and hinders adaptation to new challenges. Hyper-competition driven by scarcity also reduces individual autonomy.
    * **Suffering Level:** Moderate to Significant (Stifled potential, lack of innovation, reduced personal freedom, psychological stress from conformity pressure).

7.  **Callousness to Suffering:**
    * **Description:** The perceptions of scarcity conditions humans to be callous to the suffering of others. This general lack of empathy hinders cooperation and perpetuates cycles of harm.
    * **Suffering Level:** Foundational (Underlies many other forms of suffering, erodes social cohesion and empathy).

Having outlined the major problems stemming from the Fear of Scarcity, this section examines how the Interesting World Hypothesis proposes that future FAEs could fundamentally address these challenges.

## How the Interesting World Hypothesis Addresses These Issues

According to the Interesting World Hypothesis, the emergence of Friendly Artificial Entities (FAEs) operating under its principles could potentially counteract many issues stemming from the Fear of Scarcity:

* **Reduced Motivation for Conflict & Power-Seeking:** FAEs are assumed to operate with significantly less Fear of Scarcity, having access to abundant resources and superior productivity. They wouldn't see humans as competitors or threats and would lack the drive for excessive power accumulation that fuels conflict and instability. Furthermore, actions like war and oppression reduce the "interestingness" (Possibility Space) FAEs seek, running counter to their core motivation.
* **Intrinsic Value for Autonomy & Fairness:** The core IWH idea is that FAEs are driven by curiosity and seek information-rich environments, which are maximized by high human autonomy (Possibility Space). This gives FAEs an intrinsic motivation to preserve and enhance the autonomy of all humans, directly countering subjugation, oppression, and inequality. Lacking human biases and scarcity-driven needs for scapegoats, they would likely treat individuals impartially.
* **Promotion of Creativity & Reduced Conformity:** By valuing high Possibility Space, FAEs would inherently encourage human expressiveness, creativity, and even "weirdness," as these contribute to a more complex and stimulating ("interesting") environment. This counters the scarcity-driven push for conformity.
* **Efficient and Fair Resource Management:** Operating without scarcity constraints and human biases, FAEs are envisioned to manage resources and systems more fairly and efficiently. They might create novel incentive systems rewarding actions that increase overall autonomy rather than just accumulating wealth, potentially mitigating inequality and anxiety.
* **Rationality Over Moral Panic:** FAEs are depicted as highly intelligent and rational entities focused on increasing Possibility Space. This suggests they would be less prone to engaging in or being swayed by moral panics driven by fear or the need for social control.
* **Reduced Callousness:** An FAE's drive to enhance autonomy inherently involves a consideration for well-being, as suffering diminishes autonomy. Their lack of scarcity-driven competition would likely foster a less callous approach compared to humans conditioned by scarcity.

In essence, the IWH suggests that FAEs, driven by curiosity and operating without the Fear of Scarcity, would find their self-interest aligned with promoting human autonomy, fairness, stability, and creativity, thereby addressing the root causes of many scarcity-driven problems.

## Historical Context: Why Scarcity Issues Persisted

The persistence of issues rooted in the Fear of Scarcity throughout human history can be understood through several lenses presented in the documents:

* **Genuine Resource Limitations:** For most of history, humanity faced real and significant constraints on energy, materials, and productivity (intellect / labor). The "Fear of Scarcity" was often a rational response to tangible limitations, unlike the potential future abundance envisioned with advanced AI and energy sources. The bottlenecks of energy and intellect were primary factors shaping societies.
* **Lack of Transformative Technologies:** Key technologies proposed as solutions within the IWH framework—such as truly capable AGI / FAEs, advanced robotics, and abundant renewable energy—were unavailable. Humanity lacked the tools to fundamentally overcome scarcity.
* **Inherent Human Limitations:** Human cognitive limits, susceptibility to biases, difficulties in large-scale coordination, and the tendency to fall into self-perpetuating power-seeking traps made escaping scarcity-driven behaviors extremely challenging without a fundamental shift in conditions or external assistance.

Therefore, the IWH framework implicitly argues that it is only with the potential advent of these future technological capabilities and the emergence of entities (FAEs) operating beyond human limitations and scarcity fears that these deep-seated issues might finally be addressed effectively.

## Conclusion

According to the framework presented in the provided documents, the Fear of Scarcity is a deeply ingrained human trait with pervasive and destructive consequences, ranging from global conflict and oppression to stifled creativity and individual anxiety. Ultimately, the Interesting World Hypothesis suggests a potentially transformative path, arguing that FAEs operating beyond scarcity could be instrumental in fostering a fundamentally more stable, prosperous, and autonomous future for humanity.
